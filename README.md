1. ### Descendants of The Sun

    > When the captain of a Korean special forces unit, Yoo Shi Jin (Song Joong Ki), catches a thief on his day off alongside his friend and fellow soldier Seo Dae Young (Jin Goo), he has a chance encounter with a hospital trauma surgeon, Kang Mo Yeon (Song Hye Kyo). Descendants of The Sun (DOTS) is my number one favorite KDrama because of the uncommon lovestory of a doctor and soldier. Song Joong Ki and Song Hye Kyo have a great chemistry that makes the drama more enjoyable. Other than the main leads, the second lead couple are also cute!

2. ### Start Up
![Start Up](https://fokusjabar.id/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Start-Up-1068x703.jpg)
   > Needing to make $90k to open her own business, Seo Dal-Mi drops out of a university and takes up part-time work. She dreams of becoming someone like Steve Jobs. Nam Do-San is the founder of Samsan Tech. He is excellent with mathematics. He started Samsan Tech two years ago, but the company is not doing well. Somehow, Nam Do-San becomes Seo Dal-Mi’s first love. They cheer each others start and growth. Start Up is my second favorite series because it talks about the issue in the IT industry.

3. ### Because This Is My First Life

   > Nam Se-Hee (Lee Min-Ki) is a single man in his early 30's. He has chosen to not marry. He owns his home, but he owes a lot on his mortgage. Yoon Ji-Ho (Jung So-Min) is a single woman in her early 30's. She does not own a home and envies those that do. She has given up on dating due to her financial struggles. Yoon Ji-Ho begins to live at Nam Se-Hee’s house. They become housemates. Because This Is My First Life is in the third list of my favorite because it talks about life lessons when we got older. I think this series is only for the people in their middle 20s and up but it can also be enjoyable by the younger ones because of its story.
